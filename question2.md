### Reuters-RCV1

#### rcv1subset5, rcv1subset3, rcv1subset1, rcv1subset4, rcv1subset2

https://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#LewisEtAl2004

This dataset is a well-known benchmark for text classification methods. It has 5 subsets, each one with 6000 articles assigned into one or more of 101 topics. The Reuters-K500 dataset was obtained by selecting 500 features by applying the method proposed in [Tsoumakas et al. 2007].


### TMC2007

https://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#SrivastavaEtAl2005

It is a subset of the Aviation Safety Reporting System dataset. It contains 28596 aviation safety free text reports that the fligth crew submit after each flight about events that took place during the flight. The goal is to label the documents with respect to what types of problem they describe. The dataset has 49060 discrete attributes corresponding to terms in the collection. The safety reports are provided with 22 labels, each of them representing a problem type that appears during a flight. Also the dataset TMC2007-500, which was obtained doing a features selection of the top-500, is included.


### genbase

https://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#DiplarisEtAl2005

It is a dataset for protein function classification. Each instance is a protein and each label is a protein class. This dataset is small comparatively with the large number of labels.


### birds

https://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#BriggsEtAl2013

It is a dataset to predict the set of birds species that are present, given a ten-second audio clip.



### emotions

https://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#TsoumakasEtAl2008

Is a small dataset to classify music into emotions that it evokes according to the Tellegen-Watson-Clark model of mood: amazed-suprised, happy-pleased, relaxing-calm, quiet-still, sad-lonely and angry-aggresive. It consists of 593 songs with 6 classes.


### Mediamill

https://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#SnoekEtAl2006

It is a multimedia dataset for generic video indexing, which was extracted tom the TRECVID 2005/2006 benchmark. This dataset contains 85 hours of international broadcast news data categorized into 100 labels and each video instance is represented as a 120-dimensional feature vector of numeric features.


### Medical

https://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#PestianEtAl2007

The dataset is based on the data made available during the Computational Medicine Centers 2007 Medical Natural Language Processing Challenge 10 . It consists of 978 clinical free text reports labelled with one or more out of 45 disease codes.


### Yeast

https://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#ElisseeffWeston2001

This dataset contains micro-array expressions and phylogenetic profiles for 2417 yeast genes. Each gen is annotated with a subset of 14 functional categories (e.g. Metabolism, energy, etc.) of the top level of the functional catalogue.
